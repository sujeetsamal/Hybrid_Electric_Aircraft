# Hybrid_Electric_Aircraft
Hybrid Electric Aircraft Concept is a system-level aerospace project modeling a parallel hybrid propulsion aircraft. It integrates MATLAB power analysis, Simulink nonlinear flight dynamics, Fusion 360 CAD design, and structural validation. The model includes thrust–drag equilibrium and hybrid power blending to simulate realistic cruise performance.
